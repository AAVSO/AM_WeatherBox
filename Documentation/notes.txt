First Beta ran for 10 months.
looks like board power supply failed.
   - won't light up with ethernet/POE cables, though cables checkout
   - power via usb shows 2.7V on the 5V pin, 1.6V on the 3.3V pin
       - serial port will not stay up.
       
- wiring notes, different from the schematic:
   skysensor:
   Vin    red
   Gnd    blk
   SCL    blue   goto pin 44
   SDA    white  goto pin 43
      note this is the alternate I2C interface
      the primary pins were physically blocked

     brn  to gnd
     blu  to 47   sense line

     yel  out+
     
Voltage plan:
  48V --(via ethernet)--(POE/megaboard)-- Vin is 9V  --- bump up board--  12V to rainsensor          
                              |                         
                              |-- 5V -- to sky sensor
  The problem is that the board needs to come with a heat sink for its voltage adapter.
      This is probably what failed.
