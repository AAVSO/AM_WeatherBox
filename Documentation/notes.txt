First Beta ran for 10 months.
looks like board power supply failed.
   - won't light up with ethernet/POE cables, though cables checkout
   - power via usb shows 2.7V on the 5V pin, 1.6V on the 3.3V pin
       - serial port will not stay up.
       
- wiring notes, different from the schematic:
   skysensor:
   Vin    red
   Gnd    blk
   SCL    blue   goto pin 44
   SDA    white  goto pin 43
      note this is the alternate I2C interface
      the primary pins were physically blocked 
      
   rain sensor
     wire from    RG-        to the arduino  
     brn          COM        arduino gnd  
     blu          NO         47   sense line
     grn          PWR2       return (gnd) of boost converter
     yel          PWR1       12V of boost converter
    swtich settings:   3 & 5 on
       "It's raining" mode,  very sensitive,
       output monostable, extended 15 minutes
    For wire I used cat 5, which has 4 pairs. Ignore the white wire of each
     pair and you have brn, blu, grn and yel   
       
     
Voltage plan:
  48V --(via ethernet)--(POE/megaboard)-- Vin is 9V  --- bump up board--  12V to rainsensor          
                              |                         
                              |-- 5V -- to sky sensor
  The problem is that the board needs to come with a heat sink for its voltage adapter.
      This is probably what failed.
